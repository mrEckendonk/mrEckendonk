### Hi there 👋

I like to fix and optimize servers and remote coding as a Full Stack Developer. As a speed freak things have to go fast, so I dedicate myself to optimize everything that comes on my working path.```

💞️I love to code.
👀 I will find a solution for any existing problem(s).
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that will enhance my learning.
🌱 I’m always learning new things.
🥅 2022+ Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects.
⚡ Fun fact: I love reading pdf books.
📫 How to reach me mike.e@vecks.com.br
🛠️ Currently available for a remote work.
